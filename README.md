# LogisticRegression
Using the mathematical principle of classification, predict the probability of a given scenario using  the power of machine learning. Taking a dataset which had probable outcomes of an event, we can train a Logistic Regression model and predict future outcomes as well. The graphical representation has been done using matplotlib.pyplot library. Change the filetype from csv to whatever your filetype is in the syntax 'pandas.read_csv'

The output has been attached as an example
